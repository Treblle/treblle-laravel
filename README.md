Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box you get:
* Real-time API monitoring and logging
* Auto-generated API docs with OAS support
* API analytics
* Quality scoring
* One-click testing
* API managment on the go
* and more...

## Requirements
* PHP 7.2+
* Laravel 6+

## Dependencies
* [`laravel/framework`](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework)
* [`guzzlehttp/guzzle`](https://packagist.org/packages/guzzlehttp/guzzle)
* [`nesbot/carbon`](https://packagist.org/packages/nesbot/carbon)

## Installation
Install Treblle for Laravel via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ composer require treblle/treblle-laravel
```

## Getting started
You can get started with Treblle **directly from your Artisan console**. Just type in the following command in your terminal:
 
```bash
$ php artisan treblle:start
```
The command guides you through a process and allows you to create an account, login to your existing account, create a new project and get all the .ENV keys you need to start using Treblle.

You can also visit our website <https://treblle.com> and create a FREE account to get your API key and Project ID. Once you have to simply add them to your .ENV file:

```shell
TREBLLE_API_KEY=_YOUR_API_KEY_
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID=_YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

## Enabling Treblle on your API
Open the **routes/api.php** and add the Treblle middleware to either a route group like so:

```php
    Route::middleware(['treblle'])->group(function () {
        
        // YOUR API ROUTES GO HERE
        Route::prefix('samples')->group(function () {
            Route::get('{uuid}', [SampleController::class, 'view']);
            Route::post('store', [SampleController::class, 'store']);
        });

    });
```

or to an individual route like so:

```php
    Route::group(function () {
        Route::prefix('users')->group(function () {
            
            // IS LOGGED BY TREBLLE
            Route::get('{uuid}', [UserController::class, 'view'])->middleware('treblle');

            // IS NOT LOGGED BY TREBLLE
            Route::post('{uuid}/update', [UserController::class, 'update']);
        });
    });
```

You'r all set. Next time someone makes a request to your API you will see it in real-time on your Treblle dashboard alongside other features like: auto-generated documentation, error tracking, analytics and API quality scoring.

## Configuration options
You can configure Treblle using just .ENV variables:

```shell
TREBLLE_IGNORED_ENV=local,dev,test
```
By default Treblle will ignore requests made on the **local** environment. If you want to change that you can define your own ignored environments, by using a comma separated list, or allow all environments by leaving the value empty.

```shell
TREBLLE_MASKED_FIELDS=email,user_address,phone_number
```
Treblle **masks sensitive information** from both the request and response data **before it even leaves your server**. The following parameters are automatically masked: password, pwd, secret, password_confirmation, cc, card_number, ccv, ssn, credit_score. You can add your own custom list by simply defining them as a comma separated list in the variable above.
