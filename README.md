Treblle is a lightweight SDK that helps Engineering and Product teams build, ship & maintain REST based APIs faster.

## How Treblle Works
Once youâ€™ve integrated a Treblle SDK in your codebase, this SDK will send requests and response data to your Treblle Dashboard.

In your Treblle Dashboard you get to see real-time requests to your API, auto-generated API docs, API analytics like how fast the response was for an endpoint, the load size of the response, etc.

Treblle also uses the requests sent to your Dashboard to calculate your API score which is a quality score thatâ€™s calculated based on the performance, quality, and security best practices for your API.

> Visit [https://docs.treblle.com](http://docs.treblle.com) for the complete documentation.

## Security

### Masking fields
Masking fields ensure certain sensitive data are removed before being sent to Treblle.

To make sure masking is done before any data leaves your server [we built it into all our SDKs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#fields-masked-by-default).

This means data masking is super fast and happens on a programming level before the API request is sent to Treblle. You can [customize](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#custom-masked-fields) exactly which fields are masked when youâ€™re integrating the SDK.

> Visit the [Masked fields](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields) section of the [docs](https://docs.sailscasts.com) for the complete documentation.


## Get Started

1. Sign in to [Treblle](https://app.treblle.com).
2. [Create a Treblle project](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#creating-a-project).
3. [Setup the SDK](#install-the-SDK) for your platform.

### Install the SDK

Install Treblle for Laravel via Composer by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
composer require treblle/treblle-laravel
```

You can get started with Treblle **directly from your Artisan console**. Just type in the following command in your
terminal:

```bash
php artisan treblle:start
```

The command guides you through a process and allows you to create an account, login to your existing account, create a
new project and get all the `.ENV` keys you need to start using Treblle.

You can also visit our website [https://app.treblle.com](https://app.treblle.com) and create a FREE account to get your API key and Project ID. Once
you have them, simply add them to your `.ENV` file:

```shell
TREBLLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```


Open the **routes/api.php** and add the Treblle middleware to either a route group like so:

```php
Route::middleware(['treblle'])->group(function () {

  // YOUR API ROUTES GO HERE
  Route::prefix('samples')->group(function () {
    Route::get('{uuid}', [SampleController::class, 'view']);
    Route::post('store', [SampleController::class, 'store']);
  });

});
```

or to an individual route like so:

```php
Route::group(function () {
  Route::prefix('users')->group(function () {

    // IS LOGGED BY TREBLLE
    Route::get('{uuid}', [UserController::class, 'view'])->middleware('treblle');

    // IS NOT LOGGED BY TREBLLE
    Route::post('{uuid}/update', [UserController::class, 'update']);
  });
});
```

You're all set. Next time someone makes a request to your API you will see it in real-time on your Treblle dashboard
alongside other features like: auto-generated documentation, error tracking, analytics and API quality scoring.

> See the [docs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/integrations/laravel) for this SDK to learn more.
